Rockbuster Stealth is a movie rental company that has stores operating all over the world. With recent competition from streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, Rockbuster is looking to move to online video rentals rather than in-person. The goal of this project is to determine where the most revenue can be made based on genre, rating, actors, and other film attributes.
