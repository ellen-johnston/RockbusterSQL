Files relating to the analysis project completed using SQL for the Rockbuster Stealth Company. 

  Rockbuster Stealth is a movie rental company that has stores operating all over the world. With recent competition from streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, Rockbuster is looking to move to online video rentals rather than in-person. The goal of this project is to determine where the most revenue can be made based on genre, rating, actors, and other film attributes.
  SQL was used to determine what the most popular genres, films, and actors were for the company. It was also used to determine which cities and countries the most frequent customers were based in and how much revenue was generated there. Inlcuded is a data dictionary and a powerpoint presentation for the project. 

The data for this project was collected by Rockbuster and contains their film inventory, customers, and other related information.
